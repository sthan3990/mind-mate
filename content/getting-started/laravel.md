Laravel is the most popular PHP web framework based on the model-view-controller (MCV) model that helps you build modern web applications and API's.

Use the officially recommended Tailwind CSS utility-first framework and the UI components from Flowbite to enhance your front-end development process.

## Install Tailwind CSS with Laravel

Make sure that you have <a href="https://getcomposer.org/" rel="nofollow">Composer</a> and <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" rel="nofollow">Node.js</a> installed locally on your computer.

Follow the next steps to install Tailwind CSS and Flowbite with Laravel Mix. 

1. Require the Laravel Installer globally using Composer:

```bash
composer global require laravel/installer
```

Make sure to place the vendor bin directory in your PATH. Here's how you can do it based on each OS:

- macOS: `export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin"`
- Windows: `set PATH=%PATH%;%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Composer\vendor\bin`
- Linux: `export PATH="~/.config/composer/vendor/bin:$PATH"`

2. Create a new project using Laravel's CLI:

```bash
laravel new awesome-project

cd awesome-project
```

Start the development server using the following command:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

You can now access the Laravel application on `http://localhost:8000`.

This command will initialize a blank Laravel project that you can get started with.

4. Install Tailwind CSS and Flowbite using NPM:

```javascript
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer flowbite
```

5. Create a Tailwind CSS config file:

```bash
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

A new `tailwind.config.js` file will be created inside your root folder.

6. Add the view paths and require Flowbite as a plugin inside `tailwind.config.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = {
    content: [
      "./resources/**/*.blade.php",
      "./resources/**/*.js",
      "./resources/**/*.vue",
      "./node_modules/flowbite/**/*.js"
    ],
    theme: {
      extend: {},
    },
    plugins: [
        require('flowbite/plugin')
    ],
  }
```

This will tell the compiler from Tailwind what files to look for to properly apply the classes inside the final CSS file and it will also install the extra plugin options from Flowbite.

7. Add the directives inside the `./resources/css/app.css` file:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

8. Make sure your compiled CSS and JS is included in the `<head>` then start using Tailwindâ€™s utility classes to style your content.

```javascript
@vite(['resources/css/app.css','resources/js/app.js'])
```

9. Import the Flowbite JavaScript package inside the `./resources/js/app.js` file to enable the interactive components such as modals, dropdowns, navbars, and more.

```javascript
import 'flowbite';
```

Alternatively, you can also include the JavaScript file using CDN:

```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/flowbite/{{< current_version >}}/flowbite.min.js"></script>
```

Now that you've set everything up start up a local development server using `php artisan serve` and run the build process for Vite by using `npm run dev` or build it for production using `npm run build`.

## Flowbite components

Now that you have successfully installed the project you can start using the UI components from Flowbite and Tailwind CSS to develop modern websites and web applications.

We recommend exploring the components using the search bar navigation (`cmd` or `ctrl` + `k`) or by browsing the components section of the sidebar on the left side of this page.

<!-- ## Boilerplate Github Repository

Download or clone the Flowbite Laravel Github boilerplate repository to get access to a project that already has Laravel, Tailwind CSS, and Flowbite set up for development.

```bash
git clone ...
